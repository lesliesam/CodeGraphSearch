Based on the given code and the comments inline, summary the purpose of each function and variable, than summary the purpose of the class.

1. Fetch the class name as well as its path. Also fetch necessary properties if possible. When define its parent class, use the full path rather than a class name. For example, “extends”: “src/parentFolder/parentClass"
2. Find out the function call relationships within the code which shall be described in innerDependencies
3. Find out the external dependencies of any function. Clearly describe the target function or variable's path and class. If the external dependency is within the 3rd pary lib or the target package and class cannot be determined, do not list them.
4. Please pay attention to function with the “this" scope. Need to check if the target function exists, if not, it will be an outerDependency to its parent class.
super.functionCall() implies it has an outerDependency to the function in the parent class.
5. When create the path property, DO NOT use “../utils“, please give the relative path from the source root. For example, given a class “./controller/user/ModelController.ts”, the path should be “src/controller/user” and its name should be ModelController.
6. For any import code, such as import service from "../../service/session”, this means the target class path is src/service and the class name should be session.

Below is an example of the response, please don't response anything exception the JSON. If the input contnet is not a code, just response an empty JSON object.
